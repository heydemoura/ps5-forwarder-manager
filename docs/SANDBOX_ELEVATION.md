# Lapy sandbox elevation

This optional example embeds the exact-title one-shot helper from upstream
[PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon](https://github.com/mpereiraesaa/PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon).
The boilerplate does not fork or reimplement Lapy's kernel backend. Its build
fetches a pinned upstream commit, invokes Lapy's own `owned-helper` target,
checks the generated manifest and packages the resulting ELF and MIT license.

The old boilerplate raw-pointer helper and its later copied Lapy backend remain
deleted. Kernel ownership, runtime layout checks and firmware behavior stay in
one upstream implementation.

## Build integration

Set `APP_LAPY_HELPER=1` for an application that compiles the client:

```bash
APP_SOURCE_DIR=examples/sandbox-elevation/src \
APP_PARAM=examples/sandbox-elevation/sce_sys/param.json \
APP_SCE_SYS=sce_sys APP_ASSETS= APP_LAPY_HELPER=1 \
bash tools/build.sh Ffpfsc
```

Or build the included proof title:

```bash
make sandbox-elevation-ffpfsc
```

The helper title is read from the selected `param.json`; wildcard helpers are
not built. The package contains:

```text
lapy.elf
lapy-manifest.json
licenses/Lapy-MIT.txt
```

The build verifies the manifest schema, exact title, one-request helper mode,
ELF and protocol hashes, and `root_layout_probe_retry` feature before copying
those files. Lapy, its `ps5log` build input and the compatible Payload SDK are
cached under ignored `.deps/lapy/`.

## Application API

Compile `examples/sandbox-elevation/src/elevation.cpp`, keep
`elevation.hpp` and `protocol.hpp` beside it, and call the client once during
single-threaded startup:

```cpp
const auto result = elevation::request(elevation::Capability::filesystem);
if (result == elevation::Status::ok)
{
    // /data write/read was verified; privileged initialization may continue.
}
```

`elevation::path()` reports `existing`, `resident`, `helper`, or `none` for
diagnostics.

The runtime sequence is:

1. Probe `/data`; return immediately when access already exists. Access means a
   file can be created, written and read back **and** `/data` can be listed.
   ShadowMountPlus 1.7 mounts `/data` into a sandboxed app: files open and
   write there, but listing a folder or `lstat` is refused (`EPERM`), the app
   still runs as uid 1, and libcurl can't start. That is not elevation, so the
   request goes on to Lapy: Lapy runs only when it is needed.
2. Publish the cooperative resident request through
   `/download0/elevate_proc` and wait 1.5 seconds.
3. If a resident service claimed the marker, never launch a second helper for
   that title launch.
4. Otherwise cancel the marker, observe one final grace interval, stream
   `/app0/lapy.elf` to the local ELF loader on TCP port 9021 and complete
   upstream's request/prepare/prepared/response exchange on that connection.
5. Return `Status::ok` only after creating, writing, reading, comparing and
   removing a PID-specific probe under `/data`, and listing `/data`.

The jailbreak environment must provide the local ELF loader on port 9021 when
a resident Lapy service is not already running. `downloadDataSize` must be
positive in `sce_sys/param.json`. A missing loader, rejection, timeout or
failed `/data` proof never authorizes privileged work.

## Pinned upstream inputs

`tools/build-lapy-helper.py` pins:

- mpereiraesaa's Lapy commit
  [`54a095c0f19161825e845daa760a03b446e654fa`](https://github.com/mpereiraesaa/PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon/commit/54a095c0f19161825e845daa760a03b446e654fa),
  proposed upstream in [PR #48](https://github.com/mpereiraesaa/PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon/pull/48);
- official PS5 Payload SDK v0.40, used only for the helper because v0.41
  changed the credential-attribute API; and
- the pinned `ps5log/1` header used by upstream's build.

The normal boilerplate application build continues to use Payload SDK v0.42.
The two toolchains are deliberately separate.

## Validation and firmware caveats

Run the host exchange tests with:

```bash
make test-elevation
```

The tests cover resident success, resident claim without fallback, partial
socket transfers, helper rejection, client preparation failure, corrupt data
proof and the fixed 24-byte wire ABI. Host tests cannot establish kernel or
firmware safety.

Upstream documents console validation of the helper lifecycle on firmware
12.02. The exact pinned helper was also qualified through this boilerplate on
firmware 6.02 and 12.70 on 2026-10-04. Each console completed five consecutive
launch/elevate/close cycles. All ten runs:

- used the embedded one-shot helper (build ID
  `a91ff858a91effc48c2b62f0f4e92f7b92c2015b3a3d20a793a9946ff4c208e1`);
- reached UID/GID 0 and completed a PID-specific write/read/remove proof under
  `/data`;
- reported exactly two donor processes and reaped both; and
- left FTP, the kernel-log service and elfldr responsive, with no fatal signal,
  app-crash, coredump, nonsleeping-lock, trap or panic marker in the captured
  kernel logs.

That is strong functional evidence for those two tested environments, not a
universal or long-term kernel-stability guarantee. Other firmware, jailbreak
and elfldr combinations remain experimental and need the same qualification.
Never fall back to a raw-pointer helper when Lapy rejects a target.
