# PS5 Native App Boilerplate

[![Build](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-native-app-boilerplate/actions/workflows/tooling.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-native-app-boilerplate/actions/workflows/tooling.yml)
[![License: GPL-3.0-or-later](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0--or--later-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Build modern C++20 homebrew applications for PlayStation 5 from Linux, WSL, or
Windows. The repository root is a complete graphical Hello World skeleton:
create a repository from the template, edit `src/main.cpp`, and build a
deployable title. C sources and C libraries remain supported at explicit ABI
boundaries.

The application and all repository-owned build tools are native C/C++. LLVM
handles ordinary linking; a small project-owned converter emits PS5 metadata
and the development FSELF. The public SDK, static zlib, and optional packaging
dependencies are fetched on demand into the ignored `.deps/` cache. No
proprietary Sony SDK file or proprietary runtime module is required. The
optional `.ffpkg` target builds the external UFS2Tool with .NET 8 or newer;
the application and repository-owned tooling remain C/C++.

## Project status

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Host build | C/C++ pipeline verified through Make on Linux/WSL and PowerShell on Windows |
| PS5 hardware | Current C++20 skeleton and runtime verified on firmware 6.02 and 12.70 |
| Runtime shim | Project-authored, reproducible artifact with no proprietary implementation code |
| Output formats | Title folder and its ZIP; UFS2 `.ffpkg`; compressed `.ffpfsc` switched off for now |
| Update check | Optional kit; run on a PS5 against the homebrew.page catalog (see [Update check](#update-check)) |
| CI | Runs the native Linux Make workflow and reproduces the runtime shim |

Firmware and homebrew-loader behavior vary. The generated runtime is verified
on 6.02 and 12.70; validate the exact artifact on other target environments
before distribution. Do not present two tested versions as universal firmware
compatibility.

An opt-in [elevation example](docs/SANDBOX_ELEVATION.md) is a cooperative client
for upstream
[PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon](https://github.com/mpereiraesaa/PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon).
With `APP_LAPY_HELPER=1`, the build fetches Lapy at a pinned commit, invokes
its unmodified exact-title `owned-helper` target, verifies the generated
manifest and packages the helper ELF. At startup the client gives a resident
Lapy service a bounded opportunity, then sends the packaged helper to the
local ELF loader on TCP port 9021. Only a real `/data` write/read proof returns
success. The default skeleton remains sandboxed; see the elevation guide for
firmware caveats.

An opt-in [update check](#update-check) lets an app listed on
[homebrew.page](https://homebrew.page) tell its user that a newer release
exists: two standalone files that ask the catalog over the console's own HTTPS
and compare content versions. It needs no elevation and installs nothing.

For a real interface (menus, lists, dialogs, settings screens), use the
companion [ps5-homebrew-ui](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-ui):
an OpenGL kit built on this template, with about a hundred reusable
components, thirty themes, finished screens and a PC preview. This template
stays a small foundation; [User interface](docs/USER_INTERFACE.md) says how
the two fit together.

## Quick start

### Create a project from the template

For a new application, select **Use this template** on GitHub, then choose
**Create a new repository**. This creates an independent repository with a
clean history. The same workflow is available through the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo create my-ps5-app \
  --template blackbearreloaded/ps5-native-app-boilerplate \
  --public \
  --clone
```

Use `--private` instead of `--public` when appropriate. Fork this repository
only when preparing a contribution back to the boilerplate. A direct clone is
best reserved for temporary local experiments because it retains the
boilerplate remote and history.

The checked-in skeleton deliberately uses the development identity
`PPSA99999`, with concept code `99999`. Keep it for a single local development
copy; assign a unique identity before distributing an app or deploying
multiple projects derived from this template.

### Prerequisites

On Ubuntu, Debian, or WSL install Git, Make, Python 3 with virtual-environment
support, Clang 18, lld 18, clang-format, clang-tidy, `curl`, `wget`, and
`unzip`.
Windows users may use the same WSL path or the retained PowerShell frontend.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git make ninja-build ccache pkg-config python3 python3-pip python3-venv tar wget unzip \
  clang-18 clang-format-18 clang-tidy-18 lld-18
```

The optional presentation-asset converter uses DirectXTex `texconv` and
Windows PowerShell, either directly or through its Bash frontend in WSL.
FFmpeg may run on Windows or inside WSL. ATRAC9 output additionally
requires a compatible `ps4_at9tool.exe` that you are legally permitted to use;
the repository neither bundles nor downloads that encoder. Packaging tools are
fetched into `.deps/` automatically when their Make targets are requested.
`make ffpkg` additionally requires the .NET SDK 8 or newer to build UFS2Tool.

The first build fetches the pinned public PS5 payload SDK and zlib 1.3.2 source
archives, verifies both digests, compiles zlib into the ignored
`.deps/native/` cache, then generates the clean-room `runtime/libc.prx` from
source. Host unit tests similarly fetch a verified GoogleTest release into
`.deps/test/`; GoogleTest is never linked into PS5 output. Check the host first
with `make doctor`.

### Build the template

1. Initialize a distinct identity. The command coordinates title ID, concept
   ID, content ID, name, and category in [`sce_sys/param.json`](sce_sys/param.json):

   ```bash
   make init TITLE_ID=PPSA12345 APP_NAME="My Native App"
   ```

   Add `APP_CATEGORY=media` for a Media-area application.
2. Build:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

Bare `make` fetches missing native dependencies, generates and verifies
`runtime/libc.prx`, then builds the complete application folder and
`dist/<TITLE_ID>.zip`. The ZIP contains the title folder at its root, ready to
extract and upload to `/data/homebrew`. Package builds also produce this ZIP.

Compilation uses Ninja and ccache. Ninja rebuilds only affected objects when
sources, included headers, or compiler flags change, and uses all available
logical CPUs by default. Host tools are shared between the app and libc builds.
Use `make BUILD_JOBS=8` to limit parallelism or `make USE_CCACHE=0` to disable
the compiler cache; both settings can also go in `.env`.

`ccache --show-stats` reports cache usage. `make clean` removes generated
outputs but preserves ccache's default user cache and downloaded dependencies.
GitHub Actions uses the same Ninja build, all runner CPUs, and persistent
dependency and compiler caches. Every pull request gets an installable build named
by its number and commit: see [Pull-request builds](docs/PULL_REQUEST_BUILDS.md). Packaging and asset copying still run on each
requested build so presentation assets stay current.

To use a library from PacBrew, run `make pacbrew-list`, then build with a
space-separated module list such as `make PACBREW_PACKAGES="sdl2 openssl"`.
The prebuilt ports image is verified and cached inside `.deps/`; no global
installation is performed. See [PacBrew dependencies](docs/PACBREW.md).

The finished title directory is written to `dist/<TITLE_ID>/`. Stage that
entire directory with a compatible loader such as
[ShadowMountPlus](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus); `eboot.bin`
cannot be deployed by itself.

Tagged releases also provide `<TITLE_ID>.zip`. Extract it locally and upload
the enclosed `<TITLE_ID>/` folder to `/data/homebrew`; do not upload the ZIP
itself. The ZIP is the one release format; every entry is stored as 0777.

For a short development loop, build and update the title folder under
`/data/homebrew` through an already-running FTP service:

```bash
make deploy PS5_HOST=192.168.1.100
```

Remove only this title's staged folder and same-ID image artifacts when the
development copy is no longer needed:

```bash
make undeploy PS5_HOST=192.168.1.100
```

The default FTP port is `2121`. Each file is uploaded under a hidden temporary
name and promoted only after its transfer completes; `eboot.bin` and
`sce_sys/param.json` are published last. Use `DEPLOY_FORMAT=ffpfsc` or
`DEPLOY_FORMAT=ffpkg` when an image is specifically required. Launching and
closing the app remain explicit manual steps. `undeploy` does not unregister a
Shell entry. See [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

Do not relaunch an `.ffpfsc` immediately after replacing the same pathname:
ShadowMountPlus may still have the previous image mounted. Fully close the
title, deploy the completed replacement, then either restart ShadowMountPlus
cleanly or restart the PS5. Afterward, start the approved services normally and
wait for ShadowMountPlus to rediscover the title before launching it. Keeping
the same title ID preserves separate `/download0` and save data; `/temp0` is
temporary, `/app0` comes from the new image, and Shell presentation metadata
may remain cached.

For values used repeatedly on one workstation, copy the tracked example to the
hidden, ignored local configuration and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

GNU Make reads `.env`; it is appropriate for host addresses and build choices,
not app identity or release metadata. Keep those in `sce_sys/param.json`.

Run `make help` to list the focused targets. `make deps` only prefetches native
dependencies, `make libc` forces runtime reproduction, `make lint` runs
clang-format and clang-tidy, `make test` runs the host unit and integration
suites, and `make packages` emits the folder, `.ffpkg`, and `.ffpfsc` forms. On Windows
PowerShell, `./build.ps1` and
`./tools/rebuild-libc.ps1` remain equivalent supported entry points.

Read [Getting started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) before the first build.

## Customize the application

### Source and metadata

Edit `sce_sys/param.json` to define the app identity, Games/Media category, and
PS5-format release version. Every C or C++ file under `src/` is compiled
automatically; optional build inputs use documented Make variables. The
hardware-proven
graphical skeleton is [`src/main.cpp`](src/main.cpp); edit its short scene and
entry point after creating a project. The reusable VideoOut setup and bitmap
font live in `src/demo_renderer.*` so application logic does not start inside a
large platform implementation file.

### Versioning from `param.json`

[`sce_sys/param.json`](sce_sys/param.json) is the only release-version source;
there is no `project.json` or separate Semantic Version. The relevant structure
is:

```json
{
  "titleId": "PPSA99999",
  "conceptId": "99999",
  "contentId": "UP9000-PPSA99999_00-HELLOWORLD000001",
  "contentVersion": "01.000.000",
  "masterVersion": "01.00"
}
```

- `contentVersion` is the application version, Git tag, and GitHub Release name.
  It must use `NN.NNN.NNN` exactly, without a `v` prefix. Increment it for each
  release; this project does not assign Semantic Versioning meaning to its
  fields.
- `masterVersion` is the compatible release baseline. Keep `01.00` unless a
  release intentionally changes that compatibility baseline.
- `titleId`, `conceptId`, and `contentId` identify the application rather than
  its version. Keep them stable for updates to the same installed title; change
  them together when creating a separate application.
- `sdkVersion` and `requiredSystemSoftwareVersion` are loader/platform metadata,
  not project release numbers.

For a release, update `contentVersion`, commit the exact source, run the local
gates, then tag and push that same commit:

```bash
git tag 01.002.003
git push origin 01.002.003
```

The workflow rejects a tag that differs from `contentVersion` and publishes
the verified app-folder ZIP and its `SHA256SUMS` under that version. The ZIP contains
the complete application and generated `libc.prx`. The compressed `.ffpfsc` image is switched off for now, to prevent compatibility issues with the in-app update worker and ProsperoStore, which install from the ZIP.
`ENABLE_FFPFSC=1 make ffpfsc` still builds one locally. See [Application
configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for every metadata field.

The target uses C++20 with exceptions and RTTI disabled. Allocation-free
facilities such as `std::array`, `std::span`, and `std::string_view` are
available, and the repository-owned allocation bridge supports
`std::unique_ptr`, `new`, and `delete` through the clean-room runtime. Prefer
values and unique ownership; `std::shared_ptr` and the complete libc++ runtime
are intentionally outside the baseline.

### Update check

An app listed in the [homebrew.page](https://homebrew.page) catalog can tell
its user when a newer release exists. The check is optional and isn't part of
the default skeleton: add it when your app is listed.

1. Copy the four files into your sources. Everything under `src/` is compiled
   automatically:

   ```bash
   cp examples/update-check/{update_check,console_curl}.{h,c} src/
   ```

2. Link libcurl and wrap `fcntl`, in the `Makefile` or your `.env`:

   ```make
   PACBREW_PACKAGES += libcurl
   APP_WRAP_SYMBOLS += fcntl
   ```

3. Call it once per launch, from a worker thread:

   ```cpp
   #include "update_check.h"

   update_check_result result;
   update_check_run_self(&result);
   if (result.state == UPDATE_CHECK_AVAILABLE)
       show_notice("Update available: %s", result.version);
   ```

4. Raise `contentVersion` in `sce_sys/param.json` with every release. That
   number is what the catalog and the check compare.

`update_check_run_self` reads the app's own title ID and `contentVersion` from
`/app0/sce_sys/param.json`, asks the catalog over HTTPS (libcurl and OpenSSL,
verified against the console's certificate list), and answers one of three
things: an update is available, the app is up to date, or nothing can be said
(no network, the app isn't listed). It works in the normal sandbox and in an
elevated app, and never downloads or installs anything. Shipping libcurl means
shipping its licence notices; the guide lists them.

### Self-update

The update check tells the user; the self-update example goes one step
further and lets a listed app **replace itself with its newest release**. The
app asks its user, downloads the release ZIP and shows the progress and time
left; a small helper program, started through the console's payload loader,
unpacks it and puts the new version in place once the app has closed.

1. Copy the kits and build the helper into the app:

   ```bash
   cp examples/update-check/{update_check,console_curl}.{h,c} src/
   cp examples/self-update/self_update*.{h,c} src/
   ```

   ```make
   PACBREW_PACKAGES += libcurl
   APP_WRAP_SYMBOLS += fcntl
   APP_ROOT_FILES += build/self-update/self-updater.elf

   app ffpkg ffpfsc packages: self-update-helper
   ```

2. Check, ask, start, and close when it is staged:

   ```cpp
   #include "self_update.h"

   if (self_update_check_self(&offer) == SELF_UPDATE_AVAILABLE)   // worker thread
       ask_user("Version %s is available. Update now?", offer.version);
   self_update_start(&job, self_update_console(), &offer);       // the user said yes
   self_update_poll(&job, &status);                              // every frame
   if (status.phase == SELF_UPDATE_READY && self_update_apply(&job) == 1)
       sceSystemServiceLoadExec("exit", nullptr);
   ```

The catalog's signature and the release's SHA-256 are verified before anything
is replaced. Release entries replace matching top-level app entries while
unlisted installation or user files remain in place; a failure at any step
leaves the app as it was. The example
title updated itself on firmware 6.02 and 12.70 on 2026-10-04, preserving an
unlisted top-level user file; the guide records those runs and what they did
not cover.

### Read-only application assets

Put fonts, images, configuration defaults, shaders, and other packaged data
under `assets/`. The build copies the directory recursively without
conversion:

```text
assets/fonts/ui.bin  ->  /app0/assets/fonts/ui.bin
```

Open packaged files through absolute `/app0/assets/...` paths. `/app0` is
read-only; writable application state belongs under `/download0`. The Hello
World example loads and renders `assets/banner.txt` at runtime.

### Application filesystem paths

Access depends on the title metadata, loader, firmware, and successful mount
APIs. These statuses describe this project's hardware-tested baseline; do not
treat a conditional path as available until the application verifies it.

| Path | Access | Status and intended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/app0/` | Read-only | The application image ran on firmware 6.02 and 12.70; packaged asset reading was directly observed on 6.02. Contains `eboot.bin`, `sce_sys/`, `sce_module/`, and packaged assets. |
| `/download0/` | Read/write, persistent | Validated across relaunches on 6.02 when `downloadDataSize` is positive. Use for configuration, pairing state, caches, and logs. Its host backing file is `/user/download/<TITLE_ID>/download0.dat`; applications must use `/download0`, not that host path. |
| `/temp0/` | Read/write when mounted; temporary | Not available in the tested 6.02 ShadowMount native-title environment: opening a file returned `0x80020002`. Do not depend on it without a successful runtime probe. |
| `/savedata0/`, `/savedata1/`, ... | Read/write after a successful SaveData mount | Not part of this baseline. The investigated ShadowMount title could not complete SaveData initialization, so no save-data mount or write was validated. |
| `/common/lib/` | Read-only | System-provided shared modules; observed in process module paths. Never modify or package replacements there. |
| `/common_ex/lib/` | Read-only when present | Firmware/loader-dependent extended shared-library namespace; not validated by this template. |
| `/addcont0/`, ... | Normally read-only when mounted | Conditional add-on-content mounts requiring matching content and entitlement; untested here. |
| `/trophy/` | System-managed, conditional | Not general application storage and untested here. Use the platform trophy APIs only when supported. |
| `/usb0/`, `/usb1/`, ... | Conditional | External-storage visibility and write access depend on title permissions and loader context; untested here. |
| `/data/`, `/user/` | Outside the supported app sandbox | Do not use from a normal application. Paths seen by payloads or FTP services do not imply application access. |

`/download0` and mounted save data are separate from `/app0`, so replacing an
application folder or `.ffpfsc` does not inherently replace them. Provide an
export/import path for data that must survive title removal or cache clearing.

### Presentation assets

**Keep everything the home screen shows in `sce_sys/`, under these exact
names, committed to your repository.** This is the layout the build packages,
the console reads, and catalogs look for.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This structure is what makes an app conformant with the
> [ps5-homebrew-catalog](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-catalog), the catalog behind
> [homebrew.page](https://homebrew.page). Its automation finds your app, takes
> its icon and reads its release version from these files at these paths.
> Follow it and your app can be listed and updated automatically; deviate and
> it has to be listed by hand and never shows updates to users.

| File | What it is | Format | Needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sce_sys/param.json` | Title ID, name, and release version (`contentVersion`) | JSON | Yes |
| `sce_sys/icon0.png` | Home-screen tile | 512x512 PNG | Yes |
| `sce_sys/pic0.dds` | Background while the app is selected | 3840x2160 BC7 DDS | Optional, with `pic1.dds` |
| `sce_sys/pic1.dds` | Background while the app launches | 3840x2160 BC7 DDS | Optional, with `pic0.dds` |
| `sce_sys/snd0.at9` | Music while the app is selected | 48 kHz ATRAC9, at most 2 MiB | Optional |

Why standardize on it:

- **The build copies exactly these names** from `sce_sys/` into the app, and
  `make assets-check` validates their formats. A file under another name or in
  another folder is not packaged.
- **The ps5-homebrew-catalog reads them from your repository.** It takes your
  icon and your release's `contentVersion` from `sce_sys/icon0.png` and
  `sce_sys/param.json` at the release tag, without downloading your release.
  An app that keeps them elsewhere, or generates them only at build time, has
  to be listed by hand and can't show updates. The catalog's
  [submission guide](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-catalog/blob/main/docs/submitting.md) and
  [App versions](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-catalog/blob/main/docs/versioning.md) pages say what else
  it expects: a GitHub release tagged with the version, and a `contentVersion`
  raised in every release.
- **Anyone can find them.** Developers, tools and reviewers look in one place.

Keep app content (textures, sounds, data the app loads itself) in `assets/`,
not in `sce_sys/`. The editable sources of the backgrounds may stay beside
them as `background-source.png` and `launch-background-source.png`; they are
not deployed. If your app lives in a subfolder of a larger repository, keep
the same layout inside that folder: `<app>/sce_sys/`.

Replace the icon and background with one command:

```powershell
./tools/prepare-assets.ps1 `
    -Icon C:\art\icon.png `
    -Background C:\art\background.png
```

From WSL, use the equivalent Bash frontend and POSIX paths:

```bash
./tools/prepare-assets.sh \
    --icon /mnt/c/art/icon.png \
    --background /mnt/c/art/background.png
```

The asset tool validates the required dimensions and prepares the PS5-facing
formats. Use `-SelectionBackground` and `-LaunchBackground` when the selected
app and launch/loading screens should differ.

Prepare a 15-second selection-audio excerpt from MP3, M4A, AAC, WAV, or FLAC:

```powershell
./tools/prepare-assets.ps1 `
    -Audio C:\music\selection.mp3 `
    -AudioDuration 15 `
    -At9Tool C:\tools\ps4_at9tool.exe
```

The WSL equivalent is:

```bash
./tools/prepare-assets.sh \
    --audio /mnt/c/music/selection.mp3 \
    --audio-duration 15 \
    --at9-tool /mnt/c/tools/ps4_at9tool.exe
```

The default is 15 seconds; the tool and validator support the documented
2 MiB Shell envelope up to a safe 87.3-second stereo excerpt. Exact audio
constraints and ready-made `.at9` handling are documented in
[Presentation assets](docs/PRESENTATION_ASSETS.md).

## Build outputs

| Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dist/<TITLE_ID>/` | Complete directory-style application |
| `dist/<TITLE_ID>.zip` | Archive of the application folder, generated by every app build |
| `dist/<TITLE_ID>.ffpkg` | Optional uncompressed UFS2 image |
| `dist/<TITLE_ID>.ffpfsc` | Compressed PFS image; switched off for now (`ENABLE_FFPFSC=1`) |
| `build/` | Generated compiler, linker, and validation intermediates |
| `runtime/libc.prx` | Generated loader shim; also copied to `sce_module/` |

`build/`, `dist/`, `.deps/`, and `.local/` are intentionally ignored.
`runtime/libc.prx` is generated by `make`, ignored by Git, and copied into the
application image. Its expected digest remains tracked in
`runtime/libc.prx.sha256`.

## Scope

This project builds a directory-style homebrew application and optional
filesystem images. It does not create a signed retail PKG/FPKG, automate an
exploit, alter console configuration, or bundle Sony files. GPU decoding and a
general-purpose C library are outside this foundation. So is a user-interface
toolkit: that lives in the separate
[ps5-homebrew-ui](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-ui)
project, which is built on this one.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Keep the template small, reproducible, and useful to
a first-time native-app developer. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for
the required checks.
